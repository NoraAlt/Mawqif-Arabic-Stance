# Stance Annotation Guidelines

#### Overview
In this job, you will be presented with tweets that are about (*target*). Review the tweets to determine the authorâ€™s stance or outlook toward this specific target. To do that, imagine that you were the author of the tweet and try to answer the following questions:
- Is your intention to support or be against the (*target*)?
- Does the tweet explicitly mention the (*target*)?

#### Steps
1. **Read** the tweet.
2. **Classify** the tweet to a stance (Favor, Against, None) towards the target.
3. **Determine** if the tweet explicitly or implicitly mentions the target.

**_Note:_** _Please evaluate the tweet based on the author's intent and do not include your own personal opinion on the subject._

#### Rules Tips
The tweets can be classified as Favor, Against, or None:
1. `Favor`
means that we can infer from the tweet that the author supports the target. This could be because of one of two reasons:
   - The tweet is **explicitly supporting** the target or something aligned with the target.
   - The tweet is **NOT in support of or against anything**, but it has some information (news, quote, story, etc.), from which reveals the author supports the target.
2. `Against`
means that we can infer from the tweet that the author is against the target. This could be because of one of two reasons:
   - The tweet is **explicitly against** the target or something aligned with the target.
   - The tweet is **NOT in support of or against anything**, but it has some information (news, quote, story, etc.), which reveals the author is against the target.
3. `None`
means that the tweet provides no hint as to the stance of the author toward the target. This could be because of one of two reasons:
   - There is **no evidence** in the tweet to judge the author's stance (e.g., inquiries, news that does not express any positive or negative position).
   - The tweet is **irrelevant** to the target.

# Sentiment and Sarcasm Annotation Guidelines

#### Overview
In this job, you will be presented with different tweets. Review the tweets to determine the **sentiment** of the tweet, and whether it is **sarcastic** or not.

#### Steps
1. **Read** the tweet.
2. **Classify** the sentiment of tweet (positive, negative, or neutral).
3. **Determine** if the tweet contain sarcastic content or not.

#### Rules Tips
1. The sentiment of a tweet can be classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral :
   - `Positive` means the speaker is using positive language, for example, expressions of admiration, fostering, success, positive emotional state (happiness, optimism, praise, etc.).
   - `Negative` means the speaker is using negative language, for example, expressions of complains, criticism, negative emotional state (sadness, anger, pessimistic, fear, etc.).
   - `Neutral` means the speaker is neither using positive language nor using negative language (i.e., the tweet is only informative in nature and provides no hint as to the mood of the author).

2. The tweet can be classified as Sarcastic or Not Sarcastic :
   - `Sarcastic` means the text expresses an evaluation whose literal polarity is different from the intended polarity to hurt someone emotionally or criticize something in a humorous way.
   - `Not Sarcastic` means the text is not ironic.

#### Important Notes
- Please annotate the sentiment of tweets based on the language used in the text regardless of the author's stance toward any topic.
- Please annotate the sentiment of tweets regardless of being sarcastic or not. For example:a sarcastic text usually carries a negative implicit sentiment, while it is expressed using positive expressions.
