# Mawqif: A Multi-label Arabic Dataset for Target-specific Stance Detection

- This repository contains the data and classifier used in the paper titled "Mawqif: A Multi-label Arabic Dataset for Target-specific Stance Detection" accepted to appear at [WANLP](https://sites.google.com/view/wanlp2022/home?authuser=0), [EMNLP 2022](https://2022.emnlp.org) . **Link to the paper:** [here](https://preview.aclanthology.org/emnlp-22-ingestion/2022.wanlp-1.16/)

- *Mawqif* is the first Arabic dataset that can be used for target-specific stance detection. 

- This is a multi-label dataset where each data point is annotated for stance, sentiment, and sarcasm, which will provide a benchmark for the three tasks.

- We benchmark *Mawqif* dataset on the stance detection task and evaluate the performance of four BERT-based models. Our best model achieves a macro-F1 of 78.89\%, which shows that there is ample room for improvement on this challenging task.

- In addition to the annotated tweets, we also release the **annotation guidelines**, and the **code** used to build a standard pipeline under the [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) framework to fine-tune BERT-based models for stance detection.

# Mawqif Statistics

- This dataset consists of 4,121 tweets in multi-dialectal Arabic. Each tweet is annotated with a stance toward one of three targets: ‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccine,‚Äù ‚Äúdigital transformation,‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen empowerment.‚Äù In addition, it is annotated with sentiment and sarcasm polarities.

- The following figure illustrates the labels‚Äô distribution across all targets, and the distribution per target.
